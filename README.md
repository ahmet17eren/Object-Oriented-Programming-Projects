# Object-Oriented-Programming-Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio for the projects completed during the **CMPE 160: Object-Oriented Programming** course at **Boğaziçi University**. Each project demonstrates a deep understanding of Java, modular system design, and the practical application of object-oriented principles.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 📂 Project 1: Brick Breaker Arcade Game
A high-performance implementation of the classic arcade game featuring dynamic physics and real-time interaction.
* [cite_start]**Core Logic:** Implemented ball movement physics using trigonometric vector decomposition[cite: 206, 208].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Mechanics:** Developed a robust **collision handling system** for walls, paddles, and corners using dot product calculations for realistic reflection vectors[cite: 213, 297, 303].
* [cite_start]**Features:** Includes a scoring system, pause/resume functionality, and multiple difficulty variants (e.g., accelerating ball velocity and shrinking paddle size)[cite: 199, 413, 550, 559].

### 📂 Project 2: This Is The Only Level (Puzzle Platformer)
A unique puzzle platformer featuring an elephant character navigating through a single level with evolving mechanics.
* [cite_start]**System Architecture:** Built using a modular 4-class architecture (**Stage, Player, Map, Game**) ensuring clear separation of concerns[cite: 21, 119].
* [cite_start]**OOP in Action:** Utilized encapsulation to manage stage-specific properties like gravity, velocity, and custom key mappings across 5 distinct stages[cite: 22, 120].
* [cite_start]**Interactive Elements:** Implemented complex spatial interactions including collision detection, button/door mechanisms, and responsive UI with a death counter and timer[cite: 46, 112, 114].

### 📂 Project 3: Gold Trail - The Knight's Path
A comprehensive pathfinding and optimization application that navigates a knight through diverse terrain types.
* [cite_start]**Algorithmic Core:** Integrated **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to guarantee the least-cost route through different terrains (Grass, Sand, Impassable)[cite: 574, 577, 649].
* [cite_start]**Route Optimization (TSP):** Developed a bonus heuristic solution for a variation of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, visiting all objectives efficiently using a Nearest-Neighbor approach[cite: 577, 712, 720].
* [cite_start]**Visualization:** Provides real-time animation of the pathfinding process using the StdDraw library, logging every movement with high precision[cite: 576, 667, 746].

## 🛠 Engineering Principles & Skills
* **Languages & Tools:** Java, StdDraw Library.
* **Design Patterns:** Modular architecture, Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD).
* **Algorithms & Logic:** Dijkstra’s Pathfinding, TSP Heuristics, Vector Physics, and Collision Detection.
* [cite_start]**Documentation:** Every project includes a detailed technical report covering implementation details and system architecture[cite: 1, 568, 751].

## 📝 Usage
Each project is located in its respective folder (`hw1`, `hw2`, `hw3`). [cite_start]Source codes are in the `src` or `code` directories, and full technical reports are available as PDFs for detailed review[cite: 1, 568].
